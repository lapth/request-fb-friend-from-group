## 1st bug fix from facebook

Not sure exactly which date, it was some day in September 2019.

**Before**

After opening the user list from a group, we should see a "Add Friend" button next to each user name.

**Now**

After this script has been created about 5 days and executed for some accounts ... that button was disappeared ... what's up?
